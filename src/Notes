ECMAScript is a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.

The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items value.

To center our box we use the align-items property to align our item on the cross axis, which in this case is the block axis running vertically. We use justify-content to align the item on the main axis, which in this case is the inline axis running horizontally.
